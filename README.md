# Krypto Labs 
This is a React JS project which allows users access to data for the current top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Data includes market capitulization, price, circulating supply, 24 hour low and high as well as percentage changes from up to one year timeframes. [Krypto Labs App](https://krypto-labs.pages.dev/)

## My plan / approach
### 1. Wireframing
Krypto Labs has 2 different pages, the home page where the top 10 cryptocurrencies are listed on and the display information page where it shows the data of the specific coin the user selects. 
### 2. Back-end development
Axios was used in this project to interact with the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation). 
### 3. Front-end Development
React hooks like useState, useEffect and useParams are used in this project. The overall front-end component involved the following steps: 
1.HTML Structure for all pages 
2.Display data from API
3.CSS stylings
